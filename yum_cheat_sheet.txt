## Remove a yum Package

It's not easy. How do you differentiate between *"a file that was required by something I have since removed"* from *"a file that is not required by anything else that I really want"*?

You can use the package-cleanup command from the yum-utils package to list "leaf nodes" in your package dependency graph. These are packages that can be removed without affecting anything else:

`$ package-cleanup --leaves`

This will produce a list of "libraries" on which nothing else depends. In most cases you can safely remove these packages. If you add --all to the command line:

`$ package-cleanup --leaves --all`

You'll get packages that aren't considered libraries, also, but this list is going to be so long that it probably won't be useful.

**Example Removing Mono**

```bash
#Remove mono
sudo yum remove mono-core

#Check which unused packages are on the system.
package-cleanup --leaves
```

After running `package-cleanup` we see the following packages.

- glib2-devel-2.50.3-3.el7.x86_64
- libgdiplus-2.10-9.el7.x86_64
- libsysfs-2.1.0-16.el7.x86_64

When scrolling up to see mono's dependencies one of them happened to be _*libgdiplus*_ this should be cleaned up as well.

Lets clean up the unused packages.

```bash
sudo package-cleanup --quiet --leaves --exclude-bin | sudo xargs yum remove -y
package-cleanup --leaves
```

I had to run this a few times in order to remove all the leaves of unused packages.  It did not remove glib2, as that is in a bin directory.

## Yum history

```bash
#Re run a yum command from previously.
sudo yum history repeat

#See history of yum runs.
sudo yum history list

#See history of yum summary aggregated by user.
sudo yum history summary

#Get info a yum instance
sudo yum history info <number>

#Remove packages installed by a certain run of yum install
sudo yum history undo <number>
#or you can redo
sudo yum history redo <number>

#Clear yum history
sudo yum history new
```
